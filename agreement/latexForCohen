'''Data    $$n_{ij}$$ frequency counts of agreeing raters
    k    The number of raters
    N    The number of objects to be put in categories
    m    The number of categories
    Si    \frac{1}{k(k-1)}\sum_{j=1}^m n_{i,j}(n_{i,j} -1)
    PA    \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N S_i$
    PE    \sum_{j=1}^m Pj^2
    K      \frac{P(A) â€“ P(E)} {1-P(E)}
    According to Siegel and Casteallan: The kappa \kappa coefficient of agreement 
    is the ratio of the proportion of times that 
    the raters agree to the maximum proportion of times the raters could agree.'''
